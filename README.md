System to help manage high volume of operations
 
It is designed to manage processes on a local machine (current security constraints
doesn't allow a server hosted system).

The scheduler keeps a log of it's activity and can be interracted with through a GUI. Objective is 
to enable users to keep a control over the workflow of many interdependant processes
while automating it to a maximum extent.
